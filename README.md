## Configuration Files

The bot requires three JSON files in the project root:

- `role_settings.json`  
- `embed_settings.json`  
- `seen_settings.json`

If they do not exist, the bot will create empty ones, but you should seed them with a basic structure to avoid errors in `/embed` commands.

> **âš  Warning:** Ensure *embed_settings* file contain at least the default structure below before first use.

### Sample `embed_settings.json` structure

```json
{
  "default": {
    "title": "",
    "description": "",
    "url": "",
    "color": "2fc8b6",
    "footer": {
      "text": "",
      "icon_url": ""
    },
    "image": "",
    "thumbnail": "",
    "author": {
      "name": "",
      "url": "",
      "icon_url": ""
    },
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "",
        "value": "",
        "inline": false
      }
    ],
    "buttons": [
      {
        "label": "",
        "emoji": "",
        "style": "link",
        "url": "",
        "embed": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Seen Reactions**  
  Configurable `seen` reaction per channel via `/seensettings` in order to easily show that user has read the message.  

- **Thread Creation**  
  Auto-opens a thread when a message starts with `[thread name]`.  

- **Doodle Hub**  
  Forwards detected Doodle links to a dedicated hub channel with context and reference to original message. Ensures all doodles links are in one place so that they could be filled easily. Adds a `checbox` emoji reaction to all forwarded doodles to allow easy marking as completed. Supported doodle links can be specified in `example.docker-compose.yml`.  

- **Reaction Summary**  
  The first message in every thread shows all reactions on the source message. Made because on mobile devices it was impossible to see reactions to original post while reading thread.

- **Continued Discussion `[cd]`**  
  Adds `seen` reaction to posts with `[cd]` inside a thread.

- **Polls**  
  Auto-adds reaction options based on message content.
  Syntax:

```discord
> - emote0 option-0-description
> - emote1 option-1-description
```

- **All-Message Notification**  
Automatically pings users with a specified role in every thread for full visibility and receiving notifications.
